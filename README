=== A classic ASP website with something coming close to an ORM

The interesting part of this project is in the 'public/includes/' subdirectory. It contains
something that might almost be called an ORM. It also includes Django-style Field and Form classes.

The rest of the files are an implementation of a simple web site for selling tickets for sports events.
It is not by any means useful.

=== PostgreSQL specific code

There are some places where the code is PostgreSQL specific. I've made my best to mark those with comments,
but I'm sure I missed some...

=== LICENSE

The code is provided in the public domain.

=== Why?
This a project of mine for a university course. I was forced to use classic ASP.

I decided I will not, under any circumstances, use VBScript. So, I was left with JScript.

I had used Ruby On Rails and Django before for a few projects and was
definately not happy with the usual VBScript / ASP spaghetti code (consult
every ASP book or tutorial).

So, I started researching for an MVC framework for js and ASP (huh). I found a
few simple files that didn't really helped me. Then I found this:

http://github.com/remi/classic-asp

In the end, however, I decided not to make a full-blown framework with routing
and template system, because I didn't have the time.

So, I just focused on the object relation mapper component and using a simple
template in an include file + making classes for forms, which turned out pretty
well for me.
