This a project of mine for a university course. I was forced to use ASP.

So, I decided I will not, under any circumstances, use VBScript. So, I was left
with JScript.

I had used Ruby On Rails and Django before for a few projects and was
definately not happy with code like this (at best):

http://www.asp101.com/samples/viewasp.asp?file=db_edit.asp


So, I started researching for an MVC framework for js and ASP (huh).  I found a
few simple files that didn't really helped me.  Then I found this:

http://github.com/remi/classic-asp

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  In the end, however, I decided not to
make a full-blown framework with routing and template system, because I didn't
have the time.

So, I just focused on the object relation mapper component and using a simple
template in an include file + making classes for forms, which turned out pretty
well for me.


This code is not by any means great, it's just something to work with.

Here are some known flaws:
* PostgreSQL specific things, that may or may not work with other DBMS.
  I've tried to mark those with comments, but I might have missed something.
